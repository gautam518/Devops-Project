1-Chapter1 Modules,comments and pip
A module is a file containing code within by somebody else (usually) which can be imported and used by our programs.
pip is the package manager for python.You can use pip to install a module on your system.

There are 2 types of modules.
1-Buitin modules -Pre installed in python. eg os
2-External modules- Need to install using pip. eg flask,tensorflow

Practice set
1-Write a program to execute twinkle twinkle little star poem in python.

print ('''Twinkle, twinkle, little star
How I wonder what you are
Up above the world so high
Like a diamond in the sky
Twinkle, twinkle little star
How I wonder what you are''')

Note:If you want to print more than 1 line then instead of write " you have to write '''. 

2-Write a python program to print the contents of a directory using os module.Search online for the function which does that.

import os
print(os.listdir())

Chapter 2 – Variables and Data Types

A variable is a name given to a memory location in a program. For example
a=30
b=”Harry”
c=71.22
Variable – Container to store a value
Keywords – Reserved words in Python
Identifiers – class/function/variable name


Data Types:
Primarily there are the following data types in Python:
Integers   Interger always comes in double quotes
Floating point numbers
Strings
Booleans
None
Python is a fantastic language that automatically identifies the type of data for us.
a = 71                                    #Identifies a as class<int>
b = 88.44                              #Identifies b as class<float>
name = “Harry”                  #Identifies name as class<Str>

#vi python3.py
a = 'harry'
b = 34
c = 35.4

print(a)
print(b)
print(c)
print(type(a))          --To check type of a 

output
harry
34
35.4
<class 'str'>

Rules for defining a variable name: (Also applicable to other identifiers)

A variable name can contain alphabets, digits, and underscore.
A variable name can only start with an alphabet and underscore.
A variable can’t start with a digit.
No white space is allowed to be used inside a variable name.
Examples of few valid variable names,

Harry, harry, one8, _akki, aakash, harry_bro, etc.

#Operators in Python
The following are some common operators in Python:

Arithmetic Operators (+, -, *, /, etc.)
Assignment Operators (=, +=, -=, etc.)
Comparison Operators (==, >=, <=, >, <, !=, etc.)
Logical Operators (and, or, not)

Arithmetic Operators
cat 4.py
a= 5
b = 6
print("a + b = " ,3 * 4)

Assignment Operators
cat 5.py
a = 34
a += 30
print (a)

Comparison Operators
cat 6.py
b = (14>=7)
print(b)

Logical operator

#convert string into int
a = "5"
a = int(a)
b = 6
print(a + b)

output = 11

There are many functions to convert one data type into another.
Str(31)         ”31” Integer to string conversion
int(“32”)       32 String to int conversion
float(32)       32.0 Integer to float conversion

Input function
To type value
input function
Write a program to ask to enter your name

a = input("enter your name")
print("my name is",a)
o/p= my name is gautam

Write a program to sum the 2 numbers.
a = input("enter the number")
a = int(a)   <--convert a to integer
b = 5
print("a +b", a + b)

o/p = 
11

Practice set.
1-Write a python program to add 2 numbers.
a = 5
b = 6
print(a + b)

2-Write a python program to find reminder when divided by 2
a = 6
b = 3
print("the reminder when a is divided by b is", a%b)

o/p=
the reminder when a is divided by b is 0

3-Use comparison operator to find whether a is greater than b or not.
take a = 34 b =80

a = 34
b = 80
print(a>b)

o/p - false

4-Write a python program to find average of two numbers enterd by the user
a = int(input("enter the first number"))
b = int(input("enter the 2nd number"))
c = (a+b)/2
print("average of 2 numbers is",c)

o/p =
enter the first number5
enter the 2nd number7
average of 2 numbers is 6.0

5- Write a python program to entered square of numbers.

a =int(input("enter the number"))
b = a*a
print("the square of number is", b)

o/p
enter the number 5
the square of number is 25

chapter3: String
string always written in ('''abc ''') or double quotes("abc")

slicing:->It is a part of strings.The index of the string starts from 0 to -1
H A R R Y
0 1 2 3 4
-5-4-3-2-1

example1:
a = "harry"
print(a[0])

output=h
example2:
a = "harry"
print(a[0:3])

output will be from 0 to 2
har
Note:You can find the lengh of string using len function
example
a = "harry"
print(len(a))

output = 5

name = "harry"
#print(name[:3])  ----->It is same as print(name[0:3])
#print(name[1:])------->It is same as print(name[1:5])
#print(name[-4:-1] ----->It is same as print(name[1:4])

slicing with skip value
We can provide a skip value as a part of our slice like this
word = "amazing"
        0123456

word[1:6:2] = mzn  <-------------It skips the every 2nd value
word[0::2]  = aaig <-------------It skips the every 2nd value
